/index.html — just mounts the game + includes one entry script.

/assets/ — your PNGs, audio, fonts (already using this).

/src/

main.js — bootstraps the game, wires input, swaps scenes.

scenes/

StartScene.js — shows LOGO2 + CLICKBOX; waits for input.

ChooseScene.js — shows CHOOSEYOURRACECAR for X ms.

RaceScene.js — shows/animates cars; later: gameplay.

core/

StateMachine.js — tiny scene/state switcher (start → choose → race).

Input.js — normalises click/keyboard/touch.

Timer.js — timeouts/intervals tied to scene lifecycle (so they clean up).

Assets.js — preloads images; later: sounds/spritesheets.

ui/ (optional) — helpers for DOM elements or canvas text.

/styles/ (optional)

game.css — move inline CSS here when ready.

How it runs (conceptually):

Entry (main) creates a StateMachine and starts StartScene.

Scenes encapsulate their own setup/teardown: create DOM/canvas nodes, add listeners, start timers; on exit they remove all of that.

Input is centralised; scenes subscribe to events they care about.

For actual gameplay, add a single game loop using requestAnimationFrame (update → render). Menu/intro scenes can stay DOM-only (cheap and simple).

Assets preload before a scene needs them (avoid flashes).

Config: keep constants (durations, image names) in one place.

Version control habits that scale:

One feature per branch (e.g., feat/choose-scene), small commits with clear messages.

Tag milestones (v0.0.1-intro-screens).

Keep main always runnable; merge via PRs.

Deploy via GitHub Pages from main so you can instantly test.

Engine or no engine?

No engine (what you’re doing): great for learning; DOM for menus, canvas for game.

Lightweight libs (optional later): PixiJS (rendering), Matter.js (physics).

Full framework (later if needed): Phaser. Trade simplicity for batteries-included.

If you want, I can:

create the /src folders and stub empty files in Canvas,

move your inline script out to src/main.js,

and wire a minimal state switcher without adding gameplay.
Say the word and I’ll do only that scaffold.
